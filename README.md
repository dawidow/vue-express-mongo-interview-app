# Fullstack Interview app (Vue and Express)

## Demo

## About project
Welcome to the repository of my fullstack project. I called it Interview full stack app. Why a fullstack? Because I created my own whole server back-end (REST API) which sends/receives and removes data from the database (MongoDB). I encourage you to check the application.

**A important information** - I don't provide any form on the site, no possibility to add or remove the question by myself. This is an application only for review and I would not like users to do more than read the content.

**The technology used:** <br/>
HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS, BEM), JS (ES6+), VueJS (Vuex, Vue-router, Vue-axios), NodeJS (Express, MongoDB), Heroku + Postman to handle http requests.

Thank you for your attention and time.
